# bad-password-keeper

note: this project was created when I tried to learned desktop app programming with C#, and I reckon it's cool though.

If you want to give a try, just download from https://github.com/traperwaze/bad-password-keeper/blob/main/publish/Password%20Keeper.zip and run the setup.exe
